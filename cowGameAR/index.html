    <h1>Collect Milk from a Flying Cow!</h1>
    <p>The idea for this game came from the cow game created for the midterm/final project. The graphics of the milk bottles and
    dung are set to appear as if the cow is producing it, and moves horizontally using perlin's noise. Ml5 is used to
    detect the position of a person's nose. A bucket is displayed on the nose position, which is used to collect the dropping
    milk and dung.</p>
